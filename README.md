DNS Switcher

Easily switch your DNS settings between three predefined options to optimize your internet experience according to your needs. This script offers a simple menu to choose from the following DNS configurations:


Google DNS: Ideal for faster access to Google services.

Default DNS: Utilizes the DNS server provided by your internet service provider, suitable for general internet surfing.

NOTO DNS: Designed for accessing Web3 domains, enhancing your Web3 browsing experience.


Prerequisites

Interface Name: The script defaults to modifying the "Ethernet" interface. If your internet connection uses a different interface (e.g., "Wi-Fi"), you'll need to modify the script accordingly. Discover your interface name by executing netsh interface show interface in a Command Prompt window.


Administrative Privileges: To modify network settings, the script must be run as an Administrator. Right-click the script and select "Run as administrator" to ensure it has the necessary permissions.


Windows Version Compatibility: This script is compatible with Windows XP and later versions. While the core functionality remains consistent across versions, there may be slight variations in command behavior or available options. Ensure your system meets these requirements for optimal script performance.


Usage

Save the script with a .bat extension, for example, changedns.bat or DNSSwitcher.bat.

Right-click the saved script and select "Run as administrator" to execute it with the necessary privileges.

Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired DNS configuration. The script will automatically apply the changes.


Note

This script simplifies the process of switching DNS settings but requires a basic understanding of network interfaces and administrative privileges on your Windows system. Adjustments to the script may be necessary to align with your specific network configuration or Windows version.
